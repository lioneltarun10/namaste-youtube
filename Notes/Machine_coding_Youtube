W will build youtube app and learn how to write code in machine coding rounds.

First we need to know the requirement clarification.

1) We need to discuss with the interviewer what features to develop.

2) Discuss the tech stack
- Tell the interviewer whether we use tailwind or not
- whether use redux or not for data management
- whether use javascript or typescript
- react-router-dom for routing
- what bundler we are using
- React testing library for testing

And with every tech stack give proper justification why we wan to use that tech stack.
This gives impression that we know what we talk , that we speak like a senior developer , think like a senior developer.

We spend 5 mins on this.

(Interviewers allow google search most of the time , but practice such that we don't need to search anything.)

3) Now create a plan , don't start coding immediately. Do low level design. 
Design the web page in front of interviewer , so the interviewer will be on same page of our design. 

Go deep into planning, discuss what will be in header, what will be in sidebar component , what will be in body component , what buttons will be in body component , what will be inside video container component , what will be inside videocard component , then on click of video card , what page it will go to , the URL of new page , the desgin of new page like header is also present ,watch video  component , video suggestion component , comment section component , etc.


Now start coding.
We will discuss with interviewer , that we can create the app from zero , installing bundler ,setting up the environment , but since we don;t have sufficient time , we can use create-react-app


First install create-react-app package

npm i -g create-react-app

create-react-app is a javascript library which we execute like "npx create-react-app namaste-youtube"


First setup the taiwind.
npm i -D tailwindcss

we don't need postcss package here , becaise create-react-app has taken care of that.

now create a config file using - 
npx tailwindcss init

Now in config file , in content array , we give what files to apply the taiwind css.

module.exports = {
  content: ["./src/**/*.js"],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}

In app.css file , make changes as below - 

@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

Developing header
Till today we have used flex , for this time lets use grid.

We have spent time on css here,
But in machine coding interview we should not spend our time on CSS.
But we should spend time on functionality like if we click on hamburger menu , our sidebar should collapse.

We collapse the sidebar based on state cariable but where do we make this state?

We make it in a global space because we have to use that state in both sidebar component and header component for hamburger menu.

So best thing is to use Redux which is a state management library.

npm i @reduxjs/toolkit
npm i react-redux

Next we create a store in utils folder.

Create a store , create a slice as appSlice.
Provide the store using a provider in app.js.

Now in interview we need to check if store is properly setup or not.

We can check through useSelector or the redux extension in chrome , where our state variables are shown

Then next we need to dispatch the action from header component, when we click on hamburger menu.

Now on clicking the hamburger , we see in redux extension that state of isMenuOpen has changed to false.

Next , we need to subscribe our sidebar component to the appSlice of store , using useSelector.

we need to subscribe to a specific part of the store.

Then we put a condition like below - 

 // Early return pattern
  if(!isMenuOpen) return null;


This type of code is known as Early return Pattern , where we check for a condition and return something if the conditin is met , else return the component code.

Or else we can also use ternary operator for isMenuOpen

Hence our functionality of toggling our sidebar menu is working.

Interviewer will be impressed when we wrote our code in redux rather than satte variables because we are thinking in terms of large scale applications.

We need to practice this many times , then only we can write the whole code fastly in front of interviewer.

Now let's build our buttonList.

buttonlist is a collection of button components. let's create a button component.Use that button component many times in buttonlist component to show all the buttons.

Now , it comes to videoContainer component.

We have to ask Interviewer whether he wants us to take data from hard-coded data or from an API.

Let's use youtube's live API for now.
Youtube gives free API to use unlike swiggy. search "youtube video api" in google. And we will also not get CORS error this time because youtube is only providing us with the API directly.

https://youtube.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/videos?part=snippet%2CcontentDetails%2Cstatistics&chart=mostPopular&regionCode=US&key=[YOUR_API_KEY]

Where should I keep the API ? In constants file in utils.

But this URL demands our API key , so we need to get our own API key.
Search youtube api key auth in google. follow the steps to create credentials for API key.

We got our API key and we have created the URL- 

const GOOGLE_API_KEY = 'AIzaSyB-VjPRN5OVWqWDxjkx832Lm-X4_dY-G1I'

export const YOUTUBE_VIDEOS_API = 
"https://youtube.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/videos?part=snippet%2CcontentDetails%2Cstatistics&chart=mostPopular&regionCode=US&key=" +
GOOGLE_API_KEY

Now where will we make our API call? In videoContainer component using useEffect.

we get below error , when we log the data from api , so go to below link and enable the youtube data API V3.

"YouTube Data API v3 has not been used in project 718923284073 before or it is disabled. Enable it by visiting https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/youtube.googleapis.com/overview?project=718923284073 then retry. If you enabled this API recently, wait a few minutes for the action to propagate to our systems and retry."
